/* Expert: the found path is theoretically the shortest one, since every point
can only be visisted once. If a routine arrives at the position of a crossroad
where another routine has already been, the latter is faster and the former
stops. The quickest route will therefore always "block" other possible routes,
which ensures that the solver always returns this route.

However, this may not always be the case due to influences from outside. Other
routes may be found earlier if the go-routines of the quickest path have to wait
(possibly if other programs need memory or processors as well), so to actually
obtain the quickest route, multiple tests are needed. This is especially visible
in the maze without any walls, where the solutions are similar but often not the
same, due to the reason I described above. */
